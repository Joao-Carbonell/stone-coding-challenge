### Scope
This project aims to help the control team track KPI and OPI metrics.

### Objective
Automate the calculation of operational indicators (KPIs), such as SLA (Number of on-time attendances / Total number of attendances) and productivity (Number of attendances / working day).


### Methodology
- Develop an API that allows: 
  - Insertion of new attendances
  - Querying existing attendances 
  - Updating attendances 
- Focus on automating Last Mile operational indicators (final stage of B2C e-commerce journey):
  - **Productivity** by Green Angel
  - **SLA** by logistics base
  - **SLA** by Green Angel

### Outcome
The ultimate goal is to allow analysts to spend more time on the analysis of strategic data, as currently, this time is wasted on data extraction and processing to later produce reports.
